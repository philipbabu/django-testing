A marketing process outsourcing agency like us can work as an extended part of your marketing team to create a low risk, low investment platform to establish and grow your business in your new target markets.



NEW PLAYERS, NEW RULES.

CEOs and top management teams of multinational corporations understand that globalisation is the most critical challenge they face today considering the persistent uncertainty, complexity and volatility in the current global marketplace. They are also keenly aware that it has become tougher during the past decade to identify internationalisation strategies and to choose which country to do business with.

Even though CEOs at most large multinational firms are well aware that emerging markets can hold the key to long-term success still, most companies have stuck to the strategies they have traditionally deployed, which emphasise standardised approach to new markets while sometimes experimenting with a few local tips. As a result, many multinational corporations are struggling to develop successful strategies in emerging markets.

A major obstacle to access growth opportunities in fast growing new economies or a new region is the strength of existing players, with their deep local-level relationships and their acute knowledge of local needs and preferences, and their enviable customer loyalty. We have the local expertise to introduce players in this new phase of global competition so that you can fast establish yourself as a local player. Many acknowledge that despite greater size, larger capital bases, superior product technology, and more sophisticated marketing tools, they are struggling to hold their own against local majors.

In 2016 we saw, fierce competition between Amazon India and Flipkart, a local major for winning market share in India`s e-commerce market. Amazon expects India to overtake Japan, Germany and the UK to become its largest overseas market and is planning to invest $5 billion. But it was never easy for Amazon to penetrate Indian markets, the massive losses posted by the these majors in previous years show just how expensive the battle for market share is in India or in any other fast growing emerging markets.



DIGITAL STRATEGY

Most consumers do online searches throughout their product-buying process, from inspiration to research to purchase. This means that you have a variety of contact points where you could influence your potential customers and this has to be done by marketer who understands your target markets veryw ellto execute these digital strategies to perfection.

We understand the breadth and depth of products and services consumption patterns across the country. Using our expertise in the region, we can make the process of discovering various customer segments online a painless process to gain a deep understanding of local market dynamics, needs and preferences.

Doing business in India is about relationships, not transactions. The emotional attachment to the transaction is greater here. People want to deal with people who understand their way. If you are accepted, then you can do business easily. Creating a highly interactive online presence here can be a daunting task.

If you are looking for best practices on how to earn and maintain long-term loyalty of the Indian consumers by creating an effective and highly interactive digital marketing strategies, we can help.

The world is moving in a direction were print media is disappearing, we don't have time for television or radio or any of those traditional marketing channels. By 2018, over a third of the world’s population is projected to own a smartphone, an estimated total of almost 2.53 billion smartphone users in the world. Which means you will have to change the way you are communicating with your prospects and this will not be possible with out a well defined and carefully planned Digital Media Strategy.

It's shocking that so many businesses are using and investing a lot in paid, owned and earned digital media, yet they don't have a well defined digital marketing strategy.

According to Statista.com, with over 460 million internet users, India is the second largest online market, ranked only behind China. By 2021, there will be about 635.8 million internet users in India.

A cross-channel, customer-focused content strategy is essential these days to successfully interact with buyers. Buyer’s proactively seek out the information they need to advance their decisions through digital and social channels, from peers and from a variety of other resources. Despite this obvious shift in the way customer’s buy and interact with products and companies, marketers sadly haven't changed their strategies to improve their customer experiences.

Even though content marketing is an area that has picked up immense speed in recent years, most content marketing managers tend to copy the trends. Content built to leave an impression and or to take the opportunity to take advantage of any major events in the industry or various other opportunistic content marketing strategies are missing these days.



We are in the age of the customers, who have more control over their buying decision than ever before. In these highly competitive markets, we understand that our priority should be to understand the audience that we need to reach, their buying cycle, and their pain points.

People want to get engaged with interesting things these days. They are getting more and more accustomed to interactive marketing strategies of these days which is engaging, informative and more importantly attractive enough to capture their attention.

Savvy marketers today are creating interactive environments that are so engaging that some of them are even brilliant enough to persuade their customers to market their products on behalf of them. These highly engaging interactions once effectively executed can always results in a ever lasting positive attitude towards the companies with which they are interacting. These small interactions can be some of the major factors that make these brands more likely to be remembered compared to their competitors.

Modern marketeers have gone so competitive that they want to see an element of brand building going on whenever a consumer contact their company.

Interactivity has already become a major part of marketing budgets of not just big firms, even the smallest ones are trying it. They are building the capabilities to open up communication channels with their consumers.
